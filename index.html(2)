        <div class="letter">
            <p>Hiiii babbyyyyy, so i made this exactly at May 23, 2025 at 7:56 pm. I wanna express my love for you in this way and honestly idk how to do this thingy like all the coding and stuff but i asked help from chat gpt(i tried my best okayüòî) hehehe i hope you'll appreciate this thing i made for you.</p>
            
            <p>Okay so a little narrative about how we met. One time, i got into a heartbreak and few days after that a friend(holly) gave me a discord link. At first it didn't matter to me because i never thought it would help me but i tried it anyways, i was being myself and speak whatever came in my mind. All racism and stuff was spoken and one time i got into an argument with rinad with some religion shi and then she muted and banned me from the server. I truly didn't care but i found my happiness in that server so i reached up to you, the girl i never thought i would spend the most of my time to, the girl i would cry over, and lastly the girl that i would love the most.</p>
            
            <p>I asked you to do something about it and i expected you to say something harsh, however you dealt with it even taking sides on me. I was truly shocked I never thought u would so yeah i came back and did stuffs. You kept defending me until i got happy, from you my love. One time we kept yapping all over again, day by day. It helped me so much, i was happy about it and slowly getting over. We kept yapping until i developed feelings and you too! HAHAHAHAGA. You confessed first and I tried to avoid it cuz i was scared and stuff and bro i just got into a heartbreak and i wasnt fully getting over it.</p>
            
            <p>We kept yapping and stuff until one day u decided to go back w xino and bad thing i was extremely sick at that time. The moment i knew u and xino came back, i became cold and very jealous. Extremely jealous and i couldnt hold it, i let it slide but i still had feelings for you, days passed by and an argument happened that made u and xino break up. HAHAHA i hit my shot and finally got back with you. I was ready and tried not to hide my feelings anymore, we've been together for months now. We are so obsessed with eachother and very in love.</p>
            
            <p>Not until this year tho because i had some complication with school, i became very busy to the point that i couldnt reach out to you anymore, I was so drained that i couldnt even speak to you anymore and it went for months. Which I am very guilty about, I hurt you so bad and I made you cry, I am genuinely sorry for it, i cant get over it until now so i am doing my best to be myself again and prioritizing you over this school stuff(i let my mom handle this to have more time for you).</p>
            
            <p>You decided to get over me after those months with me still loving you, I was very confident that you wont leave me because i have entrusted you so much to the point that i abused your kindness, it was all my fault and im tryna make things right again. You decided to break up at May 3, 2025 and at May 4, 2025 i tried to get you back again and i kinda did(ig) i got my trust on you again and all the feelings came back. But now, it's even worse because Im lovesick lol and Im so downbad i need lots of maintenance otherwise i would be sad hahahahaahahahahahahaagahagahahaha and yeah this is our narrative.</p>
            
            <div class="signature">
